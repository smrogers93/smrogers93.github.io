            <p>I'm 25 years old and I'm brand new to the practice of coding. For several years, I worked together with my brothers in a carpentry business called Shiloh Woodworks.</p>
                
                <p>Since then, I've found that I need to be working in an environment where I can be forced to learn new skills and to adapt constantly. When I fully realize my potential as a software engineer, there's definitely going to be a party involved.</p>
            <p>Every day, I consume at least 3 cups of coffee in order to stay interested in anything longer than 10 seconds.</p>
            <p>I'm naturally a Marvel fan because of my namesake "Captain America." </p>
            <p>Who's your favorite Avenger huh?</p>
            <p>If you say Tony Stark I'm gonna whack something</p>
            <p>Anyways, what were we talking about?</p>
